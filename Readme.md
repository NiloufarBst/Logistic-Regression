# Logistic Regression with L1 and L2 Regularizations

This project implements logistic regression with L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularizations to predict customer interest in purchasing vehicular insurance. The model is trained on demographic and driving-related features from health insurance customer data to maximize the log-likelihood objective function.

 Dataset Information

The dataset consists of customer demographic and driving information, structured to predict whether a customer is likely to purchase vehicular insurance.
